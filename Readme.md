Upon landing on the homepage of the dashboard, the user is presented all of the products currently in the database.<br/>
Each product has an *Update* and an *Delete* button in the top right corner.<br/>
If the user chooses to *Update* a product, a modal window will display the current information of the product selected. The user can then edit any fields they choose.<br/>
If the user chooses to *Delete* a product, a confirmation box will apear and ask the user to confirm the product deletion.<br/>
In the side navigation bar, if the user selects the *Add Product* link, it will redirect the user to the *Update* page where the user can fill out a form with the data about the product.
